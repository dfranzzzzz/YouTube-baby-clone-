# Youtube baby clone

For this small project, the main objective was to try and practice embedding a video from any website to your website,
while also using semantic HTML tags. Although this is not responsive and does not include JavaScript programming, it still 
gave me a refresher for I have not coded in HTML and CSS for a month.
